# Hello {{ $notifiable->first_name.' '.$notifiable->last_name }},

Thank you for time and effort that you have demonstrated through the learning journey and also completing your 1x1 review conversation recently.  
You have uploaded all the necessary documents on LMS. Happy to inform that you have completed the necessary requirements as per the CTT program. 

We hope you observed yourself growing as a coach as you were part various reviews and interactions. 
Hope you received an experience in this journey that you sought to achieve. It's been a pleasure to work with somebody like you and the effort you have put for yourself. 
We have observed and appreciate the movements of you becoming the coach you are today. The journey of learning continues for you :-)

All the best from all of us at CTT.  Please find attached your CTT completion certificate and the same has been uploaded on LMS.
